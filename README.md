# Certificates
The Certificates repository serves the purpose of storing proofs of completion and links/documents for the courses I have completed. 
## How to Navigate
Each directory (paste) in this repository corresponds to PDF (or other formats) versions of the certificates for a particular course or group of courses, which can be downloaded and/or opened. Within the mentioned files, links and URLs for verification of the certificates in the corresponding platforms are available.
